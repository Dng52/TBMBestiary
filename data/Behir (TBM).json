A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.\n\nIf the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone."

  "description": "Behirs are cavern predators that hide in waiting for unsuspecting prey, slinking around with their surprisingly stealthy, serpentine body. Their blue, leathery skin is stretched over layers of fat that make the behir able to absorb most injected poisons. An organ close to the behir's stomach dissolves metals for the storage of electricity that the behir can expel in a devastating lightning breath attack. However, such attacks are not focused and the lightning scrambles the behir's brain leading to violent outbursts and confusion. It has been said behirs were created by frost giants as a means to take on dragons; their lightning seems to harm dragon-kind particularly well.",
