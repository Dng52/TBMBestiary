  "description": "Xorns are rocky skinned burrowers that live on the Elemental Plane of Earth, continuously consuming raw materials found in the endless expanse. With a voracious appetite for treasure, they may not be beyond bargaining for their meals, but their 3 claws and serrated maw means they can take it by force when needed. Caves with xorns nearby are often filled with gems for later consumption.",
