If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone."

  "description": "The remorhaz burrows deep underground in icy environments. Its internal heating system produces massive amounts of warmth to maintain a proper body temperature with the orange, spiked protrusions lining its chitinous body venting off the extra heat. Also known as polar worms, they can grow to be 40 feet long if their diets of polar bears and adventurers carry them to adulthood. A remorhazes' incredible vibrational sense allows it to sit and wait under thick layers of ice and snow, striking and swallowing whole anything that treads above.",
